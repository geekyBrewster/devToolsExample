Well, the website info said there were 2 errors, but the files I grabbed off
GitHub only had the one. The js file linked just fine. The other error
was on line 40 according to the console window in Chrome's dev tools.
I went to line 40 and saw there was a typo in the variable name.
It had showGlobal() rather than showGlobals(), so I added an 's'.
